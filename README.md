## Contents

### Phyloseq object

`fungi_phyloseq_final.rds` â€” a dataset comprising 9,835 fungal ASVs from 6,154 environmental samples, generated using 18S rRNA gene (V4 region) metabarcoding data.

### Sequence alignments

These were used to build phylogenetic trees presented in the paper.

File names include the name of the fungal group.

The `_ref` suffix indicates alignments based on reference sequences only.

The `_env` suffix indicates alignments that include both reference and environmental sequences.
